# Execution mode to build for. It sets the memory where the program will be
# executed from.
#
# Modes available:
#   - lram  : Whole application in the on-die SRAM (fastest, bounded by the
#             LRAM size). Suitable for small firmware binaries that require
#             the highest performance.
#   - psram : Whole application in external HyperRAM (larger main memory,
#             leaves the LRAM free). Suitable for larger firmware binaries
#             with minimal to no performance hit compared to lram.
#   - xip   : Code executes in place from flash, only writable data live in
#             SRAM. Suitable for very large firmware binaries, though
#             performance is bounded by the flash latency and bandwidth.
#
# Compute module support:
#   - C0-microSD  : lram (no other mode available, so this variable is ignored)
#   - C0-microSD+ : lram, xip
#   - C0-SD       : lram, psram, xip

# Set variables based on DEVICE_TYPE.
#
# The DEVICE_TYPE variable is set based on the selected Core ID you are
# building for, with the Signaloid CLI.
# To learn more on the available Core IDs see:
# https://docs.signaloid.io/docs/api/guides/execution-cores/#default-cores
#
# Possible DEVICE_TYPE values are:
#   - SIGNALOID_C0_MICROSD
#   - SIGNALOID_C0_MICROSD_PLUS
#   - SIGNALOID_C0_SD
