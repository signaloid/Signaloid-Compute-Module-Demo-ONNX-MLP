# Signaloid-Compute-Module-Demo-ONNX-MLP

This is a demo application for the Signaloid compute modules implementing
inference of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks encoded in the ONNX
format. The network accepts arbitrary probability distributions as inputs. The
Signaloid UxHw technology propagates the distributions through the compute graph
of the network. The network outputs are probability distributions, which
contribute in the network's explainability and output trustworthiness.

The default model (`signaloid-soc-application/model_a.onnx`) implements a simple
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) type neural network. The network comprises several
Fully-Connected layers, each followed by a ReLU activation function. The last
layer (output layer) is a SoftMax.

You can generate a new model with different number of layers and layer widths
using the `signaloid-soc-application/gen_mlp_onnx.py` script.

## Getting started

### 1. Prerequisites

##### Hardware:

- A supported Signaloid compute module (see [compatibility](#compatibility)) and
  its device path on your host.
- Optionally, a SD-card reader, or the Signaloid SD-Dev carrier board to connect
  the Signaloid compute module to your host machine.

##### Software:

- A [Signaloid account](https://get.signaloid.io).
- A GitHub account connected to your Signaloid account, as shown in the
  [GitHub Login guide](https://docs.signaloid.io/docs/platform/user-interface/repositories/github-login/),
  so you can build the compute module firmware on the
  [Signaloid Cloud Developer Platform](https://signaloid.io). You can also fork
  this demo repository to your own GitHub account, push your changes, and build
  your own version of the firmware.
- A Signaloid API key for authentication.
  [Create one here](https://signaloid.io/settings/api).
- The [Signaloid CLI](https://docs.signaloid.io/docs/api/signaloid-cli/intro/)
  installed and authenticated as shown in its
  [installation](https://docs.signaloid.io/docs/api/signaloid-cli/installation/)
  and
  [authentication](https://docs.signaloid.io/docs/api/signaloid-cli/authentication/)
  documentation.
- Python 3.10 or later for the host application and the flashing toolkit.
- `make`, for running the targets on the top-level `Makefile`.
- Root privileges (`sudo`) for raw block-device access to the compute modules.

### 2. Clone this repository recursively

Clone this repository recursively to get all its submodules:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/signaloid/Signaloid-Compute-Module-Demo-ONNX-MLP.git
```

If you cloned without `--recursive`, pull the submodules in with:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To update all submodules (useful for your own projects):

```sh
git pull --recurse-submodules
git submodule update --remote --recursive
```

### 3. Configure the top-level `Makefile`

1. Configure the `DEVICE` variable. This is the path to the block device your
   compute module is located (e.g. `/dev/disk4` on macOS, `/dev/sda` on Linux).
   Use `diskutil list` on macOS, or `lsblk` on Linux to find it.
2. Configure the `DEVICE_TYPE` variable for your compute module. This is the
   compute module hardware variant you are using. The supported options are:
    - `SIGNALOID_C0_MICROSD`
    - `SIGNALOID_C0_MICROSD_PLUS`
    - `SIGNALOID_C0_SD`.
3. Configure the `CORE_ID` variable matching your compute module type. This
   controls the precision and correlation tracking for your application.
   Default: `C0-*-N` core.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Selecting a wrong block device might **corrupt a real storage device**.
>
> Make sure you have correctly configured the `DEVICE` and `DEVICE_TYPE`
> variables in the `Makefile` as described above.

### 4. Build the Compute Module application

The top-level `Makefile` compiles the Signaloid SoC application on the Signaloid
Cloud Compute Engine using the
[Signaloid CLI](https://docs.signaloid.io/docs/api/signaloid-cli/intro/). It
uses the CLI to connect this repository, start a build in the Signaloid Cloud
Compute Engine, and download the resulting `main.bin` firmware. The build inputs
(source files and include paths) are defined in
`signaloid-soc-application/config.mk`.

The default `make` target connects the repository (first run only), starts a
cloud build, waits for it to finish, and downloads the firmware into
`signaloid-soc-application/<build-id>.main.bin`. To start a build run:

```sh
make
```


### 5. Flash the Compute Module firmware

Flash the downloaded binary to the module. This flashes the
`<build-id>.main.bin` (it builds and downloads it first, if needed).

```sh
make flash
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you are targeting a Signaloid C0-microSD, you will be asked to power cycle
> the device to switch modes (`Bootloader`, `Signaloid SoC`). The device will
> have finished flashing when the green LED is solid.

### 6. Run the demo

The `run-all` target of the top-level `Makefile` creates a Python virtual
environment, installs the host application dependencies, and runs the example
commands:

```sh
make run-all
```

## Host application

The host application interacts with the Signaloid compute modules. It prepares
the input data, sends them to the compute module, issues a command, waits for
the command to finish, and finally fetches the results and prints them.

The host application is designed to trigger a model inference on the compute
module. Using the default ONNX model, the application runs the inference of a
Multilayer Perceptron type neural network comprising Fully-Connected layers,
each followed by ReLU activation functions and a SoftMax output layer. The
results are plotted on a Ux histogram.

Note that the input vectors are given in a flatten format.

The input values can be either a simple floating point number or a uniform
distribution, represented in the
[concise form of uncertainty notation](https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Info/Constants/definitions.html),
i.e., `X.Y(Z)`.

For example:

- `2.5(2)`: means the value `2.5` with an uncertainty of `2` in the last digit,
  which is the uniform distribution over `[2.3, 2.7]`.
- `2.50(2)`: is the uniform distribution over `[2.48, 2.52]`.
- `422500(2500)`: is the uniform distribution over `[420000, 425000]`.

The distributional input arguments must be quoted in a linux shell.

### Dependencies

To run the Python-based host application you first need to install its
dependencies. To do that:

1. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Navigate to `./python-host-application`
4. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can automate this step by running `make venv` from the top-level `Makefile`.

### Example command

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Root privileges are required for raw access to the block device.
>
> We invoke the virtual environment's interpreter directly (`.venv/bin/python3`)
> because a plain `sudo python3` would use the system Python without the
> packages installed in the virtual environment.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Following examples assume a C0-microSD device located at `/dev/disk4`.

Basic command format:

```sh
sudo .venv/bin/python3 python-host-application/host_application.py \
	--device-path <device-path> \
	--variant <variant> \
	--model <model-path> \
	--input <inputs...>
```

Run a simple model inference using the default
`signaloid-soc-application/model_a.onnx`.

```sh
sudo .venv/bin/python3 python-host-application/host_application.py \
	--device-path /dev/disk4 \
	--variant C0-microSD \
	--model ./signaloid-soc-application/model_a.onnx \
	--input 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 "0.6(1)" "0.7(2)" "0.8(3)" "0.9(4)" "1.0(5)"
```

### Usage

```sh
usage: host_application.py [-h] -d DEVICE_PATH [-v {C0-microSD,C0-microSD+,C0-SD}] [-r] [-s] --model MODEL -i INPUT [INPUT ...] [--skip-printing-results] [--skip-plotting-results] [--benchmark] [--iterations ITERATIONS]

## Signaloid SoC application

The Signaloid SoC application runs on the core of the Signaloid compute module's
SoC. This is where the arbitrary probability distribution arithmetic is
processed.

The compute module continuously polls the command register to start processing a
new command. When a new command arrives, it parses the input buffer for the
needed input data of that specific command, it runs the computation, and finally
packs the results to the output buffer, signaling a successful computation
finish on the status register.

### How it works

The host and the compute module communicate through four regions of the module's
block-device interface: a command register, an input buffer, an output buffer,
and a status register.

**Command register.** A single 32-bit value. Selects the command (see the
command ids in [main.c](signaloid-soc-application/main.c)).

**Input buffer.** The host packs each argument into the input buffer. The
firmware parses the distributional arguments with
`UxHwFloatByteArrayToDistribution` in
[main.c](signaloid-soc-application/main.c).

**Output buffer.** The firmware packs the resulting distributions using
`UxHwFloatDistributionToByteArray` into the output buffer. The host reads the
output buffer, parses the results, plots the distributions, and prints their
particle values.

**Status register.** The firmware sets a status register through the run:
`WaitingForCommand`, `Calculating`, `Done`, or `InvalidCommand`. The host polls
this register to know when a result is ready.
